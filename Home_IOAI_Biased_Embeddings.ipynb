        "## Problem Description\n",
        "\n",
        "Language models process words as arrays of numbers, called word vectors (or word embeddings). These vectors are created based on the usage of the words in context, so they capture the distributional properties of words. Word vectors can be conceptualized as unique coordinates in a multi-dimensional space, with the distance between them capturing the semantic and syntactic relations between words.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a seminal [article](https://aclanthology.org/P16-1158/) Ekaterina Vylomova and colleagues show that word vectors trained on English data exhibit a curious property: the spatial difference between the vectors of 'king' and 'queen' is the same as the difference between the vectors of 'man' and 'woman'. This difference essentially captures **gender**. Similarly, the difference between 'king' and 'man' is the same as that between 'queen' and 'woman', capturing the notion of royalty.\n",
        "\n",
        "The way gender is reflected in word vectors has received special attention in NLP, because while sometimes word vectors capture true gender roles (e.g. a king is by definition male), other times they capture undesirable societal biases, e.g. they place 'engineer' and 'man' in the same relationship as 'housekeeper' and 'woman'. This does not seem fair, given that professions such as engineer or housekeeper should be non-gender specific.\n",
